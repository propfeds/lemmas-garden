## Research

- [ ] Investigate educational game [design categories](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563218304771)
  - Accuracy feedback
  - Unlimited/multiple attempts
  - Information tutorials and hints
  - Focused constraint
  - Progressive levels
  - Game efficiency

- [ ] Are single-player games [that weak?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131522002214)
  - Hold on, collaborative and social interactions. Discord! Reddit!

Since the number of questionnaires is not so large, qualitative evaluation instead of quantitative evaluation is acceptable at least at this point. The aims of the game, such as "incorporates the mechanics of L-systems in order to provide an interesting learning experience" or "provide ways to enhance players' arithmetic skills and strategic thinking" etc, are described ex. at the beginning of "2. Methods", so you will examine the degree to which they have been achieved or not, item by item.

to the idea of a simple plant before calendula: that's a good idea
the concept of l-systems is the growing sequence and such
maybe make a first plant that features just the (a -> b, b -> ab) sequence and then add the orientation and conditions later on in its life

basically it only focuses on plant growth instead of the actual l-systems , which I find a bit lacking
you have to dig really deep to find the underlying systems behind the plants

## Compost bin

- [ ] Get rid of daily income in the code
  - Unless there's a use for it

- [ ] Unlock conditions for each page in Lemma's book

- [ ] Tag various stuffs with readonly
- [ ] Change getLoc() to just assign loc folder at start and access a property

- [ ] Colour schemes?
- [ ] Timer function to measure growth
  - Device time measured by user is sufficient?

- [ ] Gangsta should actually store the colony reference?
  - Internal state unfriendly

- [ ] Different aspect ratios hav different graph bounds

- [ ] Compost
  - Has STAGES?
  - Supply energy
    - Don't we already have so many things that give energy

- [ ] Bundle time and coordinates into the manager class
  - [ ] Following LT's method, could also bundle the plant upgrades too

- [ ] Ask Uni of Calgary about how to make Ls easier to understand
  - Provide context: making a game about the logical aspects of Ls
  - [x] Initial email

- [ ] Change /sec indicators to /hr (in-game) and display 5x the value
  - Counter-argument: all parameters display /sec

- [ ] Popup title gets truncated on iOS if it exceeds 1 line

- [ ] Autobuy upgrade unlocks harvest automation config
  - Only unlocks in a future update (classmates!)
  - Hard to implement since there's more to LG than when to harvest

- [ ] Apex models for plants
  - [ ] Pea
  - [ ] Calendula
  - [ ] Basil
  - [ ] Campion
  - [ ] Hopleek
  - [ ] Broomrape

- [x] Make the column spacing x1.5 if there's no tax and make it branchless
- [x] On confirmation dialogue, have the action described (like in L-s menu)
- [x] Dynamical system inaccuracies
  - Context: basil is pruned at stg 0 (synth rate is 0), plant can only grow when watering. Watering should give multiples of 2 energy, but when evolving, some of the energy is truncated.
  - Well, just inaccuracies in general
  - Let's ask someone about them

- [ ] Address Lemma's attitude
  - Early game should be the time when a lot of help is needed, don't neglect your student
  - [ ] Narration revamp
    - [x] Narration tracks (as an integer)
      - [x] Basil pruned track
      - [x] Basil unpruned track
    - Lemma should also know about L-systems and tell students what rule is being enacted
    - [ ] Calendula
    - [ ] Basil
    - [ ] Campion

- [x] Pre-calendula plant:
  - [x] Pea or mung sprout
    - [x] Narration
  - [ ] Simple solitary flower
    - Tulip? But tulip is much more fancier...
    - Buttercup

- [ ] Calendula
  - [ ] Flower transforms into fruit with lower profit
    - Or maybe not, it's the tutorial plant.
  - [ ] Implement some kind of puzzle?

- [ ] Basil
  - [ ] Reversible leaf decay when pruning?
  - [ ] Align the vibes of basil & campion to make it feel smoother
  - [ ] Unlock way sooner?
  - [ ] Two types of leaf: 2 params and 3 params
  - [ ] Two types of signal: 0 and 1 params
  - [x] Rewrite instructions to encourage blooming
    - Stg 24: 'It's about to bloom soon. Cutting the bud now or watching flowers later, it's up to you.'
    - Separate stg 26 and 27 description for basil, and only stg 27 has the signal explanation
  - [ ] Add a Pruned commentary track

- [x] Rose campion
  - [ ] Shrub form
  - [ ] Lower leaf size limit
  - [ ] Why does it have 3 symbols on stage 1?
    - Remove the & after adding shrub form

  - [ ] Standalone game: spread to nearby plot instead of same plot
  - [x] Nerf spreading rate to 1/2 or sth?
  - [ ] Make it easy to calculate profit sum
  - [x] Change the propagation stage since fruit only starts generating at 19?
  - [x] Income per evolution instead of night
  - [x] Double growth cost
  - [ ] Flower turns into fruit faster
  - [x] Fruit falls off
  - [x] Add a parameter to adjust stagely income multiplier (1/2x for now?)
  - [x] Passive income
  - [x] Nerf growth cost from 4 to 5? Stage 21 is so fast, how about 28?
  - [x] Extend rose campion seed period by a few stages
  - [x] Dialogue:
  'Oh no. Maybe luminaries were right all along. Small campion, big campion,...'

- [ ] Dandelion
  - Spawn on random plot
    - [ ] Implement RNG engine

- [ ] Hopleek
  - Biting is on evolution queue instead of action?
  - [x] Leap years calculation
    - [ ] 400-year cycle wrapping
  - [ ] Hopleek schedule
  - [ ] Repelled by rose campions and sunflowers
  - [ ] Or maybe repelled by calendula and basil?

- [ ] Broomrape
  - [ ] Schedule
    - Once per 2 years? Doesn't it make broomrape faster than hopleek?
  - [ ] Propagation method
  - [ ] Get into people's shoes

- [ ] Ginger

- [ ] Sunflower

- [ ] Universal income upgrades
- [ ] Newspapers

- [x] Watering
  - [ ] Instead of putting watering on a cooldown, make it a coefficient curve or slope that either deducts or increases energy based on the last time the plant was watered. This will communicate the effects of overwatering better?
  - [ ] Auto-watering: unlocks with classmates
  - [ ] Bulk watering when holding button
    - Waters everything on 1 plot, not the entire garden
    - NO bulk harvest or prune.
  - [x] Make watering required for every stage, else the plant won't evolve.
    - [x] Timing: only make it available after half of the growth has been filled?
    - [x] Auto-watering: unlocks for free (right away, or maybe after the next plant has been unlocked) with configurable stage. That means you have likely understood this plant's growth.
    - Some plants don't need watering to evolve, such as grasses.
    - [ ] Plants start at negative stage so watering won't give too much energy?
