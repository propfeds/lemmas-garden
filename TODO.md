# To-do List

## v0: Axiom 

- [ ] Make at least 2 plants
- [ ] Stage specific desc?
- [ ] Settings menu
  - Graph mode
  - Colony view: compact (list), detailed (1), none (only renderer)
- [ ] Final bit (tau exp line) only shows when no colony

## v0: Completed

- [x] View colony shows L-system and hmm
- [x] Issue: reloading the theory or something makes the plant levels inaccurate
- [x] Issue: what if an action is performed when a colony is in the middle of an
evolution and tamper with the data mid-way through?
  - Transaction logic lol
- [x] Turn switch plant into singular upgrade that appears when no colony alive
