# To-do List

## v0: Axiom 

- [ ] Make at least 2 plants
- [x] Settings menu
  - Graph mode
  - Colony view: compact (list), detailed (1), none (only renderer)
    - [x] Stage specific desc?
      - [ ] Change binary search direction
      - [x] TODO: grab binary search from old collatz
      - [x] Also include the first line don't 
- [x] Final bit (tau exp line) only shows when no colony
- [ ] Gangsta should actually store the colony reference?

## v0: Completed

- [x] View colony shows L-system and hmm
- [x] Issue: reloading the theory or something makes the plant levels inaccurate
- [x] Issue: what if an action is performed when a colony is in the middle of an
evolution and tamper with the data mid-way through?
  - Transaction logic lol
- [x] Turn switch plant into singular upgrade that appears when no colony alive
