## Research

- [ ] Investigate educational game [design categories](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563218304771)
  - Accuracy feedback
  - Unlimited/multiple attempts
  - Information tutorials and hints
  - Focused constraint
  - Progressive levels
  - Game efficiency

- [ ] Are single-player games [that weak?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131522002214)
  - Hold on, collaborative and social interactions. Discord! Reddit!

- [ ] Research notes
  - Two players share progress with each other daily
  - Some players understand the profit puzzle for calendula, some don't
  - Players enjoy watching plants grow idly
  - Some players can't get pruning basil
  - Some players mistake max stage with max profit
  - Many players are cautious about purchasing expensive items, which isn't the 
  case usually for other theories

- Let's think about it. A plant that takes 80 minutes to grow, and you have to
do nothing. Do you feel like it could be more interesting?

## Compost bin

- [ ] Simple solitary flower
  - Tulip?
  - Buttercup
  - No need, Cally is already easy to play

- [ ] Colour schemes?
- [ ] Timer function to measure growth
  - Device time measured by user is sufficient?

- [ ] Gangsta should actually store the colony reference?
  - Internal state unfriendly

- [ ] Autobuy upgrade unlocks harvest automation config
  - Only unlocks in a future update (classmates!)
  - Hard to implement since there's more to LG than when to harvest

- [ ] Different aspect ratios hav different graph bounds

- [ ] Newspapers
- [ ] Add a Pruned commentary track
  - 2 lazy

## v0.2: Rabbits update

- [ ] Notebook shows next cost
- [ ] Tag various stuffs with readonly

- [ ] Hopleek
  - Biting is on evolution queue instead of action?
  - [x] Leap years calculation
    - [ ] 400-year cycle wrapping
  - [ ] Hopleek schedule
  - [ ] Repelled by rose campions and sunflowers
- [ ] Sunflower

- [ ] Align the vibes of basil & campion to make it feel smoother

- [x] Basil
  - [x] Adjust starting cost: 1 â†’ 1.25
  - [ ] Double starting cost but 2, 10 stepwise?
  - [x] More delay before flowering (maybe stg 24 flowers)
  - [x] Decrease max stage
  - [x] Apex decreases synthesis when spawning leaves
  - [x] Side shoots grow more leaves but smaller
  - [x] Flower gives income? Can be made into tea - although should shrink
  their power immensely
  - [ ] Bees love flowers too?!!
  - [ ] https://gardenbenchtop.com/what-happens-when-basil-flowers/

- [x] Rose campion as first bush plant
  - [ ] Maximum statements
  - [ ] Death? Propagation?
  - [ ] Shrub form?
  - [x] Income per evolution instead of night
  - [x] Double growth cost
  - [ ] Flower turns into fruit faster
  - [ ] Fruit falls off
  - [ ] Loading SLOW
  - [ ] How long does it live? When does it spread seeds?
  - [ ] Cost increases when it spreads, so need to shovel old ones before new
  - [ ] Propagation ratio: 0.5, rounded up
  - [ ] Add a parameter to adjust stagely income multiplier (1/2x for now?)
  - [x] Passive income
  - [x] Nerf growth cost from 4 to 5? Stage 21 is so fast, how about 28?
  - [x] Extend rose campion seed period by a few stages

- [x] Preference table for decimal places
- [x] Confirmation to harvest/prune
  - Options menu
- [x] updateAvailability() slow
- [x] Bookshelf unlocks after tutorial to avoid confusion with unlock plot

## v0.1: Slumber Seeds

- [x] Cap colony count to 5 per plot, unless?

- [x] Remove seed field from L-s menu

- [x] Evolution/redraw sends Redraw signal
  - Instead of going straight to origin, it backtracks

- [x] Buy All upgrade unlocks maxLevel config
  - [x] +/- buttons for adjusting maxLevel

- [x] Make the colony menu give commentary, while the stats are always
displayed on screen
  - [x] Replace stage 0 commentary with Lemma dialogue
- [x] Almanac containing plants, L-system help, etc.
  - [x] Move notebook inside
  - [x] Move the teaching from commentary to almanac

- [x] Progression (solid? maybe!)
  - [x] Double tau growth
  - [x] Divide pub mult by 2
  - [x] Don't divide ln by 2
  - [x] Double initial price of calendula and basil

- [x] Buff basil
  - [x] Rewrite descriptions for basil to reflect new balance changes
  - [x] If stage lower than first leaf, give the usual intro (move that inside
  the stages object)

## v0: Completed

- [x] Make at least 2 plants
  - [x] Idleable plant: calendula
    - [x] Fix flower model size
    - [x] Model leaves
    - [x] Write description, LS description and commentary
  - [x] Fast 'active' plant: basil
    - [x] Write description, LS description and commentary
- [x] Icons
  - [ ] SVG? Doesn't work
  - [x] Theme-dependent colour?
- [x] View menu has filter function that only shows certain symbols
  - [x] Also option to view seq without params
  - [x] Save plant-dependent filter configs
- [x] Revamp PLANT_DATA structure and the unlocking of new plants
- [x] Separate 2D & 3D graph options
  - [x] Renderer does not clear graph if 2D graph is enabled
- [x] Binary search can consume a lot of resources per turn
- [x] Settings menu
  - Graph mode
  - Colony view: compact (list), detailed (1), none (only renderer)
    - [x] Stage specific desc?
      - [x] Change binary search direction
      - [x] TODO: grab binary search from old collatz
      - [x] Also include the first line don't 
- [x] Final bit (tau exp line) only shows when no colony
- [x] View colony shows L-system and hmm
- [x] Issue: reloading the theory or something makes the plant levels inaccurate
- [x] Issue: what if an action is performed when a colony is in the middle of an
evolution and tamper with the data mid-way through?
  - Transaction logic lol
- [x] Turn switch plant into singular upgrade that appears when no colony alive
