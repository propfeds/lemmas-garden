# To-do List

- [x] View colony shows L-system and hmm
  - [ ] Stage specific desc?
- [x] Issue: reloading the theory or something makes the plant levels inaccurate
- [x] Issue: what if an action is performed when a colony is in the middle of an
evolution and tamper with the data mid-way through?
  - Transaction logic lol
- Turn switch plant into singular upgrade that appears when no colony is alive
