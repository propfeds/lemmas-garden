`Developed in 1968 by biologist Aristid Lindenmayer, an L-system is a formal ` +
`grammar that describes the growth of a sequence (string). It is often used ` +
`to model plants and draw fractal figures.

Every L-system starts with a sequence, called the axiom. From the axiom, the ` +
`sequence grows according to a set of production rules that describe how ` +
`each symbol (character) in the sequence would be rewritten in the next level.
Each rule is represented in the form of:
{symbol} = {derivation(s)}

Considering a simple system with the axiom of b and the rules:
b = a
a = ab,
the sequence will grow as follows:
Level 0: b
Level 1: a
Level 2: ab
Level 3: aba
Level 4: abaab

`Context-sensitive L-systems allow each symbol to interact with nearby ` +
`symbols, by letting an individual behave differently depending on its ` +
`ancestor (the symbol to its immediate left), and its child to the right ` +
`(children, if it opens up multiple branches). They are often used to model ` +
`forms of communication between a plant's organs.

A context-sensitive rule goes as follows:
{left} < {symbol} > {right} = {derivation}
The symbol will only evolve according to this rule if its ancestor bears the ` +
`same symbol as {left}, and one of its children bears the same symbol as ` +
`{right}.`

`Beyond geometric applications, parametric L-systems allow individual ` +

The syntax for a parametric rule goes as follows:
{symbol}({param_0},...) : {condition*} = {derivation_0} : {probability**} ;...
Examples:
I(t) : t>0 = FI(t-1)
A(t) : t>5 = B(t+1)CD(t^0.5, t-2)
